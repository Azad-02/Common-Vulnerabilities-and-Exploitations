# SQL INJECTION


#### Manual SQLi Detection

- The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.
- OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.

#### SQL injection in different parts of the query
Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query.
Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are: 
- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause. 
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values. 
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name. 
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.

> ***Warning!***    Take care when injecting the condition `OR 1=1` into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an ***`UPDATE`*** or ***`DELETE`*** statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.

#### SQLi for user login with Username and Password credentials
SQL Query includes: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`
Using the SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password check from the `WHERE` clause of the query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`


### Types of SQLi

#### 1. In-Band SQLi  
   - A. Union-Based SQLi  
   - B. Error-Based SQli  
#### 2. Inferential/Blind SQLi  
   - A. Boolean-Based SQLi  
   - B. Time-Based SQli
#### 3. Out-of-Band SQLi


#### A. Union-Based SQLi
- Effective when the SQL query results are returned to the application's response. It's useful when you need to combine the results of multiple `SELECT` statements into a single result set, which the application might display.
- Used to extract data from the database such as retrieving usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information.
-  The `UNION` keyword enables you to execute one or more additional `SELECT` queries and append the results to the original query.
-  For example:
> SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2

**For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:**
    - The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
    - The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

**Meet these two requirements to carry out attack:**
    - How many columns are being returned from the original query.
    - Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.

## Determining the number of columns required

Two effective methods to determine how many columns are being returned from the original query.

1. Injecting a series of `ORDER BY` clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. For example, if the injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause of the original query, you would submit:
  > ' ORDER BY 1--
  > ' ORDER BY 2--
  > ' ORDER BY 3--
  etc.

This series of payloads modifies the original query to order the results by different columns in the result set. The column in an `ORDER BY` clause can be specified by its index, so you don't need to know the names of any columns. When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:

> The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.

The application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but it may also issue a generic error response. In other cases, it may simply return no results at all. Either way, as long as you can detect some difference in the response, you can infer how many columns are being returned from the query. 

2. Second method involves submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values:
  > ' UNION SELECT NULL--
  > ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
  > ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
  etc.

If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error, such as:

- All queries combined using a `UNION`, `INTERSECT` or `EXCEPT` operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.

We use `NULL` as the values returned from the injected `SELECT` query because the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. `NULL` is convertible to every common data type, so it maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct.

As with the `ORDER BY` technique, the application might actually return the database error in its `HTTP response`, but may return a generic error or simply return no results.  
When the number of nulls matches the number of columns, the database returns an additional row in the result set, containing null values in each column. The effect on the HTTP response depends on the application's code. If you are lucky, you will see some additional content within the response, such as an extra row on an HTML table. Otherwise, the null values might trigger a different error, such as a `NullPointerException`. In the worst case, the response might look the same as a response caused by an incorrect number of nulls. This would make this method ineffective. 

#### Database-specific syntax

On Oracle, every `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:

> ' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--

The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. 

On MySQL, the `double-dash` sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash character `#`` can be used to identify a comment.
