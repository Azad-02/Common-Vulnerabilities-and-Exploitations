# **SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITY**


### Manual SQLi Detection

- The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as *OR 1=1* and *OR 1=2*, and look for differences in the application's responses.
  rr- OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.

### SQL injection in different parts of the query
Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the *WHERE* clause of a *SELECT* query.
Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are: 
- In *UPDATE* statements, within the updated values or the *WHERE* clause. 
- In *INSERT* statements, within the inserted values. 
- In *SELECT* statements, within the table or column name. 
- In *SELECT* statements, within the *ORDER BY* clause.

> ***Warning!***    Take care when injecting the condition *OR 1=1* into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an ***UPDATE*** or ***DELETE*** statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.

#### SQLi for user login with Username and Password credentials
SQL Query includes: *SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'*
Using the SQL comment sequence **--** to remove the password check from the *WHERE* clause of the query: *SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''*


## Types of SQLi

1. In-Band SQLi
2. Inferential / rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
