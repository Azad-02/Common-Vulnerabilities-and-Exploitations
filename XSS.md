# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Types of XSS

**1. Reflected/Non-Persistent XSS:**
  - Application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way, without permanently storing the user provided data..
  - Malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
  - Usually paired with CSRF bugs
**3. Stored/Persistent XSS:**
  - User input is stored on the target server, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. And then a victim is able to retrieve the stored data from the web application without that data being made safe to render in the browser.
  - With the advent of HTML5, and other browser technologies, the attack payload may permanently be stored in the victimâ€™s browser, such as an HTML5 database, and never being sent to the server at all.
**4. DOM XSS:**
  - User input is stored in DOM of a page without proper handling, allowing arbitrary data insertion.
  - Page itself (the HTTP response) does not change, but the client side code contained in the page executes differently due to the malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM environment.

## Identifying Reflected and Stored XSS

Follow a checklist for each input:

*1. Figuring out where the data goes:* Does it get embedded in a tag attribute? Does it get embedded into a string in a script tag?
